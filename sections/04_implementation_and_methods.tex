\textit{(The section should provide information about the expected work tasks and methods used for each task. This should include tasks to be carried out by the PhD student and by others if necessary for the implementation of the project. Contributions from the main- and co-supervisors should be identified. The implementation plan is meant to be the main tool for the PhD student and supervisor for accomplishing the PhD project. Tasks should be detailed at a level where time consumed, resources required and risks can be estimated)}
