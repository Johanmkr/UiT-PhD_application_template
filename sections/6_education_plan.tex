\textit{(List the courses that are to be included in the education plan of your PhD. Include course code, course name, how many ECTS/credits the course provides and which semester it will be taken. If the course is given outside of UiT, you must include a link/point of contact to the course description. All the courses must be on PhD level, and be given at or in collaboration with an accredited higher education institution. If it is not clear from the course description (or summer school information etc), that the course is on PhD level or how many credits the course gives, documentation from the relevant institution regarding this is necessary. Special curriculums can also be added. The education plan must be exactly 30 credits (courses can be downscaled so the plan amounts to exactly 30 credits). The plan must include 20-27 credits in the field of mathematics and natural science, 3-6 credits in philosophy of science and ethics and, if desired, 4-7 credits of courses in transferable skills. The maximum amount of credits allowed for philosophy of science and ethics, and transferable skills, is thus 10 credits. The main supervisor verifies that external courses are relevant for your PhD by signing the project description. Update the education plan whenever you complete a course or make a change regarding courses)}
