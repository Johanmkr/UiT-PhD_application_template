%   PUBLICATION PLAN
%
\textit{(Although it may be challenging to foresee and plan the publications when starting a PhD study, it is desired that some thoughts have been made at an early stage. The working titles of the manuscripts are likely to change as the research/studies progress. Nevertheless, it is useful to plan ahead and have an idea of where the project is going.}

\textit{UiT follows the EU principles of “Open Science” where the preferred dissemination channel for research results is publishing in compliant Open Access Journals or using institutional repositories to provide access to the results (see for example \href{https://munin.uit.no/}{Munin}, UiTs open research archive).  Provide a justification if you don't intend to adopt any of the above alternatives for open access publishing.}

\textit{Provide a preliminary plan for the publications. For articles, include the working title of manuscripts, when it is planned to be submitted, and also which potential journal it will be submitted to. Expand tables if needed. The table should be updated annually.}

\textit{If a monograph is to be used rather than a collection of articles, provide an explanation and give a tentative title and a detailed plan for how the work will be undertaken.}

\textit{Results that are created or achieved at the university or produced in full or part with the resources of the university, are the property of the university, as long as this does not or will not come into conflict with the rights of other parties. If the work is confounded with IPR-issues that would cause restrictions regarding the dissemination and use of the results, describe which issues this pertains to and how it will be solved. See the Regulations for securing and management of work results at UiT.)}

\textit{(It is also recommended to discuss the authorship with your supervisors and potential collaborators in order to prepare a plan for division of work. You may need to consult with \href{https://www.casrai.org/credit.html}{Credit} or \href{https://www.icmje.org/icmje-recommendations.pdf}{Vancouver Recommendations} for determining who is considered an author for a scientific work based on different contributions and roles. You should start thinking about this now, but this documentation is not required before the midway evaluation.}

\textit{To fill in the table, begin by listing all contributions/roles, and then allocate them appropriately to the contributors.}

\textit{We only expect you to have a plan for the first paper now, but this table should be updated before the annual updates and the midway evaluation)}
