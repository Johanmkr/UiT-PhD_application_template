%   DATA MANAGEMENT PLAN
%
\textit{A data management plan (DMP) is a plan that documents how you are going to manage your research data during and after the project period. On March 9, 2017, the University Board at UiT adopted Principles and guidelines for research data management at UiT, applicable from 1 September 2017. Accordingly, all researchers are required to address the relevant aspects of making their data FAIR - findable, accessible, interoperable and re-usable, including what data the project will generate, whether and how it will be made accessible for verification and re-use, and how it will be curated and preserved.

\textit{You are not expected to formulate an extensive data management plan at this stage, but you should describe how the four aspects of data management mentioned above will be addressed in your PhD project. In this regard, you are suggested to build on DMP templates and samples provided by the University Library and together with your supervisor(s), fill out the most important and relevant points to the PhD project. If you are unfamiliar with possible/relevant data sets at this point, update the plan whenever you start working with the data. The plan should be updated annually)}
