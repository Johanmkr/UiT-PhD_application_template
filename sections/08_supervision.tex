    \item \textbf{Role of the supervisors: }
\end{itemize}
\textit{(The role of the main supervisor and co-supervisor(s) is not regulated, and may be different from project to project. It is therefore important to clarify this in the project description. The PhD student needs to know what to expect from each member of the team, and the supervisors should know what their responsibilities are. Supervision at UiT should be done in accordance with the Ethical guidelines for supervision at UiT. List the role each of the supervisors will have in the PhD project, and what their contribution most likely will be. Also specify why the co-supervisors were included on the project.)}

\begin{itemize}
    \item Frequency and type of supervision: 
\end{itemize}

\textit{(Supervision can successfully be carried out in many ways and formats. The guidelines for PhD supervision at UiT state that supervision should take place at a regular basis. The supervisors and PhD student should agree on a plan for how the supervision will be implemented. If the supervisors and the PhD student clarify mutual expectations at an early stage, there should be less grounds for conflict later. Give a description of the frequency and form of the supervision of the project. Also state how the co-supervisors will be involved. In addition to informal day-to-day supervision, some formal meeting point that needs preparation from both parties, should be included. The involvement of co-supervisors should also be included in the supervision plan.)}
